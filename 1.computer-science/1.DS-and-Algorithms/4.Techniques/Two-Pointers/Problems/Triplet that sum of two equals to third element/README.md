#Find four elements that sum to a given value (4Sum) | Set 1 (n^3 solution)

Given an array of integers, find all combination of four elements in the array whose sum is equal to a given value X.

Example:

```
  Input : {5, 32, 1, 7, 10, 50, 19, 21, 2}
  Output : 21, 2, 19

  Input : {5, 32, 1, 7, 10, 50, 19, 21, 0}
  Output : no such triplet exist  
```

## Two pointer technique:

#### Step-by-step approach:




[Here](Two-pointer.example.ts) is the implementation of the above approach.

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity : O(n^3)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
