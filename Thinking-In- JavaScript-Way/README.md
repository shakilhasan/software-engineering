</a>
</h3>

People coming from other programming languages face lots of difficulties in JavaScript. This language seems super
confusing at first.

But if you start to learn thinking in a JavaScript way, you will discover how beautiful this language is! It's super
dynamic, easy to use, performant and scalable programming language.

Though JavaScript was created for web browsers, right now JavaScript can be used on the server side as well with
Node.js. We can even develop desktop applications, mobile applications, Artificial Intelligence or even IoT too. Right
now, JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages out there. So, don't waste time and
jump into JavaScript.

I would highly recommend beginners to complete "w3schools JavaScript Tutorial Series" first and then come back to this
playlist because this is an advanced JavaScript playlist.
